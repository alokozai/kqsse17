Programming language used: Java 8

Database used: Mysql

IDE used: Netbeans 8.1



Key Reasons for using the above:

  -proficiency level in Java

  -Object oriented Design would be useful in a project like this

  -Netbeans has easy connectivity with mySQL database

  -java is somewhat portable

  

Other considerations:

  -initially wanted to use php- more mobile and familiarity

  -css and html would have been easier to use to create a usable UI.

  -However Prefered IDE for web developement was going out of service, and could not install on my computer for developement.

  -any plans made based on the assumption of using php were reconsidered use in java and Netbeans
