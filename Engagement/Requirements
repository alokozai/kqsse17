Requirements for Engagement Implementation (tenDance Engagement):

Key Focus points:
  -Track Student Attendance
  -Track Engagement
  
Probable assumptions:
  -All students have either mobile smart phone or access to laptop during class. Exceptions can be made if this is not the case, such as classroom provided devices.

Ways engagement could be tracked:
  -participation grade through attendance
  -multiple choice quiz to show understanding of reading or class before that can track scores to be used for a grade(optional): created by professor
  -open ended questions, used for discussion
  -Default would be an "I'm here" button so minimum application would track attendance by students clicking a button.
