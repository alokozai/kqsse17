User testing

What would you expect an efficient attendance management system to look like.
Interesting comments-
-cold calling students
-engagement -with quizzes?
-engagement- side activities
-engagement- quizzes and test
-at least one professor is ok with cost to students…
-simple intuitive, works all the time(no down time) so redundant servers??
-one said to accept cheaters..

Obvious- no cost to students
-	Doesn’t waste time
-	Automatic
-	Secure so students do not have access to other student records (probably most important)

Exta- tardies?
