# Ideas and problem findings for Software Engineer January Phase:
- G4-CP 
    - __Problem__:
Mostly users perform copy and past functions during regular computing activities. The process of copy and past takes multiple steps from copying to going to destination and then pasting. This not only consumer memory but also CPU cycles and there is chance that at some point the user forgets to past and the memory is consumed. 
    - __Solution__:
G4-C&P merge the function of copy and past. It will work when the user copy something then the system will prompt an option for past location and it can be extended to lines or facebook profile and other location. 
    - __Literature__: 
These are some literatures that are focused on the problem of copy and past but mostly on programmer side and code re-use but we can analyze the problem that copy and past is making.

- Attendance Management System: Intelligent-A 
    - Taking attendance is a problem for professors and teaching assistants. It is time consuming and if attendance not taken there is an issue of who is present in the class and who is not. This attendance management system called is intelligient attendance. 
    - __Solution__: 
The studentâ€™s id cards will be automatically scanned through a sensor which is placed on the class room door. This data will be recorded in a database which can function as sending dailt attendance details to students as well as instructors. Each student will receive daily or weekly attendance report.
