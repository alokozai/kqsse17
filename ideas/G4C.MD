# Ideas and problem findings for Software Engineer January Phase:
- G4-CP 
    - __Problem__:
Mostly users perform copy and past functions during regular computing activities. The process of copy and past takes multiple steps from copying to going to destination and then pasting. This not only consumer memory but also CPU cycles and there is chance that at some point the user forgets to past and the memory is consumed. 
    - __Solution__:
G4-C&P merge the function of copy and past. It will work when the user copy something then the system will prompt an option for past location and it can be extended to lines or facebook profile and other location. 
    - __Literature__: 
These are some literatures that are focused on the problem of copy and past but mostly on programmer side and code re-use but we can analyze the problem that copy and past is making.

- Attendance Management System: Intelligent-A 
    - Taking attendance is a problem for professors and teaching assistants. It is time consuming and if attendance not taken there is an issue of who is present in the class and who is not. This attendance management system called is intelligient attendance. 
    - __Solution__: 
The student’s id cards will be automatically scanned through a sensor which is placed on the class room door. This data will be recorded in a database which can function as sending dailt attendance details to students as well as instructors. Each student will receive daily or weekly attendance report.

# Literature Review:
Bhalla, V., Singla, T., Gahlot, A., & Gupta, V. (2013). Bluetooth Based Attendance Management System. International Journal of Innovations in Engineering and Technology (IJIET) Vol, 3, 2319-1058.
Singla, Gahlot etal. In the paper “Bluetooth Based Attendance Management System” have presented a unique software engineering idea for attendance management problem. The problem they have addressed is “calling out individual names or by passing around an attendance sheet” and surely they are time consuming with many errors. The goal of the project is states as “The reason of the development of biometric system is to take student attendance more efficiently. This method uses the student’s matrix card to track student’s attendance and sent information to the computer and the computer will send data to a mobile phone lecturer. The listing of students will be automatic, quicker and more security intensive than current methods of registration” (228). Their solution is based on Bluetooth technology and Media Access Control system that will keep automatic track of student’s attendance by connecting to their phones. The major problem is suggested by Mr. Gerber as” development of an automated class attendance recording device. The device must positively identify students and provide reliable class attendance logs for the benefit of students, lecturers and the University, as described in the previous section” (pp. 227). The system will also be connected to a database which students can also individually access and also it will generate reports for all parties involved individually. Three systems are recommended namely as simple systems which will support card, large scale companies using finger prints, and another system supporting iris scanning and finally ecommerce performance based system. The Algorithm proposed is a tree like data structure design that will help its implementation possible. Furthermore, the design will use communication interface DLL and management setting program. 

- __Why this paper__:
Why this paper: this is a very informative paper for our project as it is also addressing the problem of attendance management system and how it is a problem for teachers and instructors to keep track of attendance scores.

This paper titled “RFID-Based Students Attendance Management System” has addressed the problem of attendance management in class and the time consuming record process. The proposed system is a technology called RFID which is “an automated identification and data collection technology” (pp. 01). This system is beneficial as it cost less, it identifies, monitor and use inventory control for data saving. 
- __Why this paper__:
Why: This is a good paper and a technology is used to solve the attendance management in developing countries. Although it does address an important software problem but its relevancy is 85% to our project. 

Patel, U. A., & Swaminarayan Priya, R. (2014). Development of a Student Attendance Management System using RFID and Face Recognition: A Review. International Journal of Advance Research in Computer Science and Management Studies, 2(8), 109-19.
This paper discusses the problem of attendance management in academic institutes. The system proposed is computer based attendance management system. The motivation to address the problem is based on the impact of attendance on student’s productivity and results in the class (pp. 1). The problem of taking attendance manually takes time and efforts to write it back and it manual entering of attendance is a headache for instructors. An important point mentioned is that students might miss their names and other sign under wrong person. The systems proposed are computerized attendance management system, Bluetooth based attendance system, NFC based attendance system, Finger based systems, iris based systems, face recognitions, mobile based system, and RFID system to track attendance (pp. 7-8). 
- __Why this paper__:
Why: this is an excellent paper which introduces various kinds of technologies for attendance management system. It will help channel our ideas into right track and probably we will come up with a system that is better, less cost, and cheaper in prices. We need to provide a system that is easily implementable, user friendly, something MAGIC we need to develop after reading these articles. MAGIC is possible we need to tell our mind to bring us that MAGIC. So here we go and we can do it.
